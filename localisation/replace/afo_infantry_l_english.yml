    great_war_defense_templates_desc:0 "We should lay the foundation for our future war strategies by coming up with specific plans for stopping enemy attacks on our territory, organizing national defense, and mobilizing the war industry."

    great_war_trench_warfare:0 "Trench Warfare"
    great_war_trench_warfare_desc:0 "When warfare becomes bogged down in field fortifications which both sides find impossible to breach, it is necessary to develop dedicated tactics and methods for such an environment. This includes troop rotation, logistics, machine gun, and artillery support and elaborate trench systems optimized for effective defense."

    pre_assault_bombardment:0 "Pre Assault Bombardment"
    pre_assault_bombardment_desc:0 "We can make the life of our infantrymen much easier by preemptively suppressing and damaging enemy forces directly before launching an assault. This will not only prevent the enemy from effectively resisting the attack, but also from moving in reinforcements quickly."

    massed_artillery:0 "Massed Artillery"
    massed_artillery_desc:0 "While crude, simply amassing great amounts of artillery can translate directly into more intensive and better support of our troops. The main challenge is properly organizing and supplying such large support formations."

    advanced_firebases:0 "Advanced Firebases"
    advanced_firebases_desc:0 "By moving artillery formations closer to the front line, they can better support our troop movments as they break through enemy formations. It does leave our artillery more vunrable to enemy counter attacks however."

    dispersed_support:0 "Dispersed Support"
    dispersed_support_desc:0 "Dispersing support artillery units will allow them to cover larger areas evenly, and thanks to improvements in coordination fire of multiple batteries they can focus down targets while other batteries reload. The more artillery available, the more effective this strategy is"

    integrated_support:0 "Integrated Support"
    integrated_support_desc:0 "Integrating artillery into specific formations in order to create organic support can have its benefits. Guns can be taken straight to the frontline with the troops and support them directly. Too much artillery however can paint pretty big targets"

    creeping_barrages:0 "Creeping Barrages"
    creeping_barrages_desc:0 "By creating an impassible wall of artillery fire moving forward at the pace of our advance we can suppress enemy strongpoints and prevent their retreat as well as sending in reinforcements. Employing this method, however, will require significant accuracy and timing to not hit our own troops by accident."

    artillery_overwatch:0 "Artillery Overwatch"

    air_killzones:0 "Air Killzones"
    air_killzones_desc:0 "In order to successfully stop enemy air raids new anti-air artillery tactics need to be developed. Creating areas of highly saturated AA fire among the enemy flight route will be able to diminish their forces quickly."

    frontline_support:0 "Frontal Support"
    frontline_support_desc:0 "We can use our large caliber anti-air guns as extremely effective tank busters. Equipped with specialized ammunition, they will perform even better than common anti-tank guns. Doing so however will require different positioning at the front lines, decreasing our ability to counter enemy aviation."

    forward_observers:0 "Forward Observers"
    forward_observers_desc:0 "Speed and effectiveness of artillery fire coordination could be drastically improved by deploying dedicated forward observers. They will be tasked with directing artillery from the front line with visual contact on their targets."

    mobile_artillery:0 "Mobile Artillery"
    mobile_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery cannot support our troops effectively if it cannot keep up with their movement. We should focus on improving its mobility and flexibility to ensure it will always be available when needed."

    stationary_battery:0 "Stationary Battery"
    stationary_battery_desc:0 "Proved and tested artillery battery tactics have shown time and again that they are indisposable. By providing more ammunition depots they can sustain fire for longer, however it does impede there movment more"

    harrassment_fire:0 "Harassment Fire"
    harrassment_fire_desc:0 "Previous experiences have shown that constantly harassing enemy troops with artillery fire, rather than constant barrages can greatly help in reducing their effectiveness. By forcing them to constantly stay awake and ready for incoming fire, enemy formations are left tired and unnerved."

    constant_barrage:0 "Constant Barrage"
    constant_barrage_desc:0 "By elongating our artillery barrages and focusing them on enemy positions, we can hope for maximum destructive power before our other formations mount their offensives"

    fire_by_command:0 "Fire By Command"
    fire_by_command_desc:0 "The top-down structure of commanding artillery will further prevent wasting of shells allowing for longer offensives against planned objectives"

    fire_by_request:0 "Fire By Request"
    fire_by_request_desc:0 "Combat experience has shown that artillery is most effective when supporting our troops directly. Giving field commanders the authorization to rapidly call in/off artillery barrages on their current targets will greatly increase its effectiveness on doing actual damage"
