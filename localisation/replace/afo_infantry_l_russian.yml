    great_war_trench_warfare_desc:0 "When warfare becomes bogged down in field fortifications which both sides find impossible to breach, it is necessary to develop dedicated tactics and methods for such an environment.

    pre_assault_bombardment_desc:0 "We can make the life of our infantrymen much easier by preemptively suppressing and damaging enemy forces directly before launching an assault.

    dispersed_support:0 "Dispersed Support"
    dispersed_support_desc:0 "Dispersing support artillery units will allow them to cover larger areas evenly, and thanks to improvements in coordination fire of multiple batteries they can focus down targets while other batteries reload. The more artillery available, the more effective this strategy is"

    integrated_support:0 "Integrated Support"
    integrated_support_desc:0 "Integrating artillery into specific formations in order to create organic support can have its benefits. Guns can be taken straight to the frontline with the troops and support them directly. Too much artillery however can paint pretty big targets"

    equal_spacing:0 "Equal Spacing"
    equal_spacing_desc:0 "By distributing anti tank guns evenly along the frontline we can provide support to all of our troops wherever the enemy attacks from."

    concentrated_spacing:0 "Concentrated Spacing"

    zeroing_artillery:0 "Zeroing Artillery"
    zeroing_artillery_desc:0 "Whenever a target is highlighted, all batteries fire in circular rounds closing in to the target. This helps catch entire formations and prevents them from escaping our shells"

    creeping_barrages:0 "Creeping Barrages"
    creeping_barrages_desc:0 "By creating an impassible wall of artillery fire moving forward at the pace of our advance we can suppress enemy strongpoints and prevent their retreat as well as sending in reinforcements. Employing this method, however, will require significant accuracy and timing to not hit our own troops by accident."

    artillery_overwatch:0 "Artillery Overwatch"

    air_killzones:0 "Air Killzones"
    air_killzones_desc:0 "In order to successfully stop enemy air raids new anti-air artillery tactics need to be developed. Creating areas of highly saturated AA fire among the enemy flight route will be able to diminish their forces quickly."

    frontline_support:0 "Frontal Support"
    frontline_support_desc:0 "We can use our large caliber anti-air guns as extremely effective tank busters. Equipped with specialized ammunition, they will perform even better than common anti-tank guns. Doing so however will require different positioning at the front lines, decreasing our ability to counter enemy aviation."

    forward_observers:0 "Forward Observers"
    forward_observers_desc:0 "Speed and effectiveness of artillery fire coordination could be drastically improved by deploying dedicated forward observers. They will be tasked with directing artillery from the front line with visual contact on their targets."

    harrassment_fire:0 "Harassment Fire"
    harrassment_fire_desc:0 "Previous experiences have shown that constantly harassing enemy troops with artillery fire, rather than constant barrages can greatly help in reducing their effectiveness. By forcing them to constantly stay awake and ready for incoming fire, enemy formations are left tired and unnerved."

    constant_barrage:0 "Constant Barrage"
