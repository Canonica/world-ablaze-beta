The M11 is meant to be a breakthrough tank and provide infantry support in all operations. Its armour is only capable of defending against infantry and other unarmoured attacks. Its turret is also unable to hold anything but a machine gun, Thus the main armament is located in the hull."

This helped keep its noise level's down, provide a smaller profile as well as create a smoother ride for the crew. It did mean however that the howitzer located in the hull had to be removed and this was unpopular at the time as Italy was very much focused on tank vs infantry mentality. The engine however is unreliable"
