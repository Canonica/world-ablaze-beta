    pol_mechanized_equipment_1_desc:0 "The C4P is an infantry transport vehicle that provides very little combat stats to its infantry, but is extremely cheap to produce and is a good option for trying to mass mechanize one's army. An issue with this is that there is a large gap until the next mechanized upgrade will arrive."

    pol_interwar_equipment_1:0 "TKS"
    pol_interwar_equipment_1_short:0 "TKS"
    pol_interwar_equipment_1_desc:0 "Based on the chassis of the British Carden Lloyd tankette, the TKS is a cheap armoured vehicle that is lightly armed. Its machine gun armament and extremely low amounts of armour make it difficult for this vehicle to succeed in any role other than reconnaissance, military policing, or light infantry support.\n\n The good speed of the vehicle can allow it to have some use when maneuvered and positioned correctly."

    pol_light_td_equipment_0:0 "TKW 2"
    pol_light_td_equipment_0_short:0 "TKW 2"
    pol_light_td_equipment_0_desc:0 "While the TKW 2 is able to pierce very light armour, it will struggle significantly in piercing any armoured vehicle that is remotely well armoured. Additionally, the firepower is worse than that of its contemporary tower anti-tank gun, giving little reason to go out of one's way to produce this vehicle."

    pol_light_spg_equipment_0:0 "TKD"

    pol_light_spg_equipment_0_desc:0 "The TKD is armed with a 47 mm infantry support gun capable of doing damage to infantry formations. As is the case with most early war light SPG's, the TKD lacks a high enough firepower to warrant allocation of entire factories to its production. Additionally, there are no potential upgrades for this vehicle."

    pol_medium_equipment_1_short:0 "7TP dw"
    pol_medium_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Polish-developed variant of the widely exported British Vickers 6-ton, the vehicle is extremely lacking in all-around offensive power. Its machine gun armament is useful for fighting against weakly armed infantry but will struggle against any form of enemy armour.\n\n As is the case with most early-war tank designs, a limited 3-person crew restricts the ability of the vehicle to operate as a coordinated fighting force in the midst of combat."

    pol_medium_equipment_2:0 "7TP jw"
    pol_medium_equipment_2_short:0 "7TP jw"
    pol_medium_equipment_2_desc:0 "This vehicle makes massive improvements on its predecessor by including a 37 mm anti-tank gun, a more reliable engine, a periscope, and a radio. While these improvements are still not enough to make the 7TP an excellent tank, the vehicle offers a mobile, reliable answer to enemy early war armour."

    pol_medium_equipment_3:0 "10TP"
    pol_medium_equipment_3_short:0 "10TP"
    pol_medium_equipment_3_desc:0 "Inspired by the American's Christie M1928 and M1931 designs, this cruiser tank has a much larger emphasis on mobility than its predecessors. The addition of a powerful engine and hydraulic steering servomechanism allow the tank to reach such speed.\n\n An enlarged hull also means that a larger crew of 4 can fit inside, greatly alleviating the task burden of the commander. The tank is very unreliable due to the use of foreign parts."

    pol_medium_equipment_4:0 "14TP"
    pol_medium_equipment_4_short:0 "14TP"
    pol_medium_equipment_4_desc:0 "The 14TP is very similar to the 10TP with exception to the increased armour that the vehicle has. The significant increase in protection allows it to be on par with the armour of many major nation's medium tanks; however, the vehicle is still likely to be pierced by most anti-tank weapons.\n\n Experience from the 10TP greatly improves reliability in this vehicle."

    pol_medium_equipment_5:0 "20TP"
    pol_medium_equipment_5_short:0 "20TP"
    pol_medium_equipment_5_desc:0 "The 20TP is equipped with a 75 mm gun capable of dealing with light and medium armour. Though its stats are on the slightly weaker end for the large cost of the vehicle, it is able to perform well given favorable conditions."

    pol_medium_equipment_6:0 "40TP"
    pol_medium_equipment_6_short:0 "40TP"
    pol_medium_equipment_6_desc:0 "Taking design elements from both the Germans and Soviets, the 40TP incorporates a German turret and armour profile of a T-34. This design is lacking in several areas for a tank this late into the war, but is fairly well-rounded for the given situation.\n\n It is able to fight medium and light armour but will struggle when dealing with modernised or heavy armour forces."

    pol_modern_equipment_1:0 "43TP"
    pol_modern_equipment_1_short:0 "43TP"
    pol_modern_equipment_1_desc:0 "Heavily overhauling the armament from any of its predecessors, the 43TP is a powerful tank that can pierce a wide range of enemies with its 100 mm gun. It is a well-rounded vehicle that can fulfill a main battle tank role."

    pol_heavy_equipment_1:0 "25TP"
    pol_heavy_equipment_1_short:0 "25TP"
    pol_heavy_equipment_1_desc:0 "The 25 TP has a very good gun for its time and decent armour for a heavy tank. Producing this vehicle in large numbers is very difficult for a non-major country but could be very valuable if such a thing were to be achieved.\n\n The profile of the vehicle causes the vehicle to suffer from somewhat low defense and breakthrough."

    pol_heavy_equipment_2:0 "45TP"
    pol_heavy_equipment_2_short:0 "45TP"
    pol_heavy_equipment_2_desc:0 "The 45TP is a massive upgrade over its predecessor. While the stats themselves are fairly well-rounded, their values pale in comparison to the heavy vehicles of major nations."

    pol_heavy_equipment_3:0 "50TP"
    pol_heavy_equipment_3_short:0 "50TP"
    pol_heavy_equipment_3_desc:0 "The 50TP is heavily armoured and capable of dealing large amounts of damage to most forms of enemy armour. While the offensive stats of the vehicle are very good, it is very costly to produce it in large numbers."

    cze_mechanized_equipment_1:0 "M53/59 Praga"
    cze_mechanized_equipment_1_short:0 "M53/59 Praga"
    cze_mechanized_equipment_1_desc:0 "The M53/59 Praga provides a very high amount of armour protection compared to most other mechanized trucks of the time period. It provides a good mix of combat stats to the infantry it carries and can be produced at a reasonable price."

    cze_scout_car_equipment_1:0 "Škoda PA-III"
    cze_scout_car_equipment_1_short:0 "Škoda PA-III"
    cze_scout_car_equipment_1_desc:0 "This scout car provides very little in terms of combat stats and is best reserved for garrison and reconnaissance duties. The vehicle is known for its reliable performance even in harsh weather."

    cze_interwar_equipment_1:0 "Lt vz 34"
    cze_interwar_equipment_1_short:0 "Lt vz 34"
    cze_interwar_equipment_1_desc:0 "Built by CKD, the Lt vz 34 is a prewar light tank that was, in many ways, ahead of its time. It included a radio and a 37 mm gun capable of dealing with enemy vehicles. Giving it fairly good combat stats when compared to other light tanks of the time."

    cze_light_equipment_1:0 "Lt vz 35"
    cze_light_equipment_1_short:0 "Lt vz 35"
    cze_light_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Lt vz 35 provides significantly improved armour protection. Redesigned observation ports also allow the crew to get a better sense of the battlefield and to acquire targets."

    cze_light_equipment_2:0 "Lt vz 38"
    cze_light_equipment_2_short:0 "Lt vz 38"
    cze_light_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Lt vz 38 is a well-rounded tank with decent firepower and armour. Even when compared to the tanks of major nations, it is still extremely capable of holding its own."

    cze_light_equipment_3:0 "Lt vz 40"
    cze_light_equipment_3_short:0 "Lt vz 40"
    cze_light_equipment_3_desc:0 "Without any upgrades to the gun since the last light tank model, the Lt vz 40 suffers from critically low firepower and is only able to fight against infantry and very light armour. Due to these issues, it is best reserved for reconnaissance and garrison duties."

    cze_light_td_equipment_2:0 "SID 32"
    cze_light_td_equipment_2_short:0 "SID 32"
    cze_light_td_equipment_2_desc:0 "The SID 32 provides no additional anti-tank capabilities over the Lt vz. 38. While cheaper, the Lt 38 is already a very cheap vehicle, so it does not make much of a difference."

    cze_medium_equipment_1:0 "ST vz. 39"
    cze_medium_equipment_1_short:0 "ST vz. 39"
    cze_medium_equipment_1_desc:0 "Also known as the V-8-H, it mounts a 47 mm gun, granting all-around anti-infantry and anti-vehicle power. Coincidentally very similar in design to the Panzer III, the design still falls short due to its four man crew still being slightly too small to deal with large amount of combat tasks."

    cze_medium_equipment_2:0 "Škoda T-24"
    cze_medium_equipment_2_short:0 "Škoda T-24"
    cze_medium_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Skoda T 24 employs well-sloped armour to increase armour protection with minimal changes to weight. Its 75 mm gun is able to cut through medium armour easily. The vehicle is also extremely fast and can be maneuvered to gain tactical advantages against enemy forces."

    cze_medium_equipment_3:0 "Škoda T-25"
    cze_medium_equipment_3_short:0 "Škoda T-25"
    cze_medium_equipment_3_desc:0 "An upgraded variant of the 75 mm gun was added to improve the vehicle's combat capabiltiies against heavily armoured vehicles. Slight improvements were also made to the armour by redesigning the turret and hull profiles."

    cze_medium_equipment_4:0 "Škoda T-40"
    cze_medium_equipment_4_short:0 "Škoda T-40"
    cze_medium_equipment_4_desc:0 "The Skoda T-40 is very similar to its predecessor, the T-25. The two are effectively the same tank, and the T-40 even loses out on stats in several instances."

    cze_modern_equipment_1:0 "Škoda T-50"
    cze_modern_equipment_1_short:0 "Škoda T-50"
    cze_modern_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Skoda T-50 completely redesigns the turret in a hemispherical deisgn, housing a 100 mm gun. This upgrade allows it to pierce some, but not all heavy tanks. Improved vision and targetting systems also results in a significantly improved breakthrough capabiltiy for this tank."

    cze_modern_equipment_2:0 "Škoda T-51"
    cze_modern_equipment_2_short:0 "Škoda T-51"
    cze_modern_equipment_2_desc:0 "The T-51 makes further massive improvement across all combat stats; however, the tank is very lightly armoured for a modern vehicle of this time. It should be able to deal with most enemy vehicles, but will struggle against heavily armoured foes."

    hun_scout_car_equipment_1:0 "P.A.2"
    hun_scout_car_equipment_1_short:0 "P.A.2"
    hun_scout_car_equipment_1_desc:0 "The P.A.2 provides extremely lackluster combat stats but is very cheap. It is best suited for reconnaissance and garrison roles and should avoid combat wherever possible. "

    hun_scout_car_equipment_2:0 "39M Csaba"
    hun_scout_car_equipment_2_short:0 "39M Csaba"
    hun_scout_car_equipment_2_desc:0 "Equipped with a radio, the 39M Csaba was able to effectively coordinate with and provide reconnaissance to other units. Only armed with a weak AT-rifle and a machine gun, the offensive stats it provides are not too useful. The vehicle is extremely fast and cheap."

    hun_scout_car_equipment_3:0 "D-442 FUG"
    hun_scout_car_equipment_3_short:0 "D-442 FUG"
    hun_scout_car_equipment_3_desc:0 "An amphibious reconnaissance vehicle capable of moving at high speed, the D-442 FUG provides efficient, active scouting. Its production cost is significantly higher than the 39M Csaba, but it is still fairly cheap to produce."

    hun_mechanized_equipment_1:0 "43M Lehel"
    hun_mechanized_equipment_1_short:0 "43M Lehel"
    hun_mechanized_equipment_1_desc:0 "The 43M Lehel provides all-around combat bonuses to mechanized infantry. This the only mechanized model available to Hungary."

    hun_interwar_equipment_1_short:0 "Burstyn Motorgeschütz"
    hun_interwar_equipment_1_desc:0 "A World War I design, this vehicle was extremely slow, under-armed, and under-armoured. The vehicle provides little offensive stats and is unlikely to succeed in anything in combat other than light infantry support. Its terrible design also means it is prone to breaking down.\n\nThis vehicle should be avoided until improved designs are made."

    hun_light_equipment_1:0 "38M TOLDI I"
    hun_light_equipment_1_short:0 "38M TOLDI I"
    hun_light_equipment_1_desc:0 "This vehicle was designed from the Landsverk L-60 hull and turret licensed from Sweden. While the stats for the tank are below average, it is overall a good tank when considering that Hungary is a minor nation. Its 20 mm autocannon is capable of piercing soft-skin vehicles, but its primary purpose should be as an infantry support vehicle."

    hun_light_equipment_2:0 "41M TOLDI II"
    hun_light_equipment_2_short:0 "41M TOLDI II"
    hun_light_equipment_2_desc:0 "The 1941 variant of the TOLDI has a 40mm gun, allowing it to deal with other light tanks in the field. At this point, most light tanks have been rendered obsolete in the combat role, and this vehicle should be used for reconnaissance only when possible."

    hun_light_equipment_3:0 "43M TOLDI III"
    hun_light_equipment_3_short:0 "43M TOLDI III"
    hun_light_equipment_3_desc:0 "This variant of the TOLDI is equipped with side skirts to grant additional protection from infantry-portable anti-tank weapons. The combat capabilities of the vehicle are still extremely lacking, and should be reserved for reconnaissance only."

    hun_light_td_equipment_3_short:0 "Toldi páncélvadász"
    hun_light_td_equipment_3_desc:0 "For a light tank destroyer, it is fairly capable for its anti-tank role, providing stats on par to that of its contemporary 44M Zrinyi. The vehicle is mobile but has very low armour and should be used with that kept in mind."

    hun_light_aa_equipment_1:0 "40M Nimród"
    hun_light_aa_equipment_1_short:0 "40M Nimród"
    hun_light_aa_equipment_1_desc:0 "For a light self-propelled anti-air, the Nimrod is a very capable anti-air vehicle. The 40 mm gun is even capable of penetrating medium and light armour and dealing high amount of damage to both vehicles and infantry. However, there are no further upgrades to this vehicle."

    hun_medium_equipment_1:0 "40M Turán I"
    hun_medium_equipment_1_short:0 "40M Turán I"
    hun_medium_equipment_1_desc:0 "Based off of the Czech LT vz. 35 and equipped with a 40 mm gun, the Turan is a good balance of stats for a minor nation. It is very well armoured for its time and is able to pierce most armoured vehicles. It is also one of the few early medium tank designs to use the 5-man crew layout. "

    hun_medium_equipment_2:0 "41M Turán II"
    hun_medium_equipment_2_short:0 "41M Turán II"
    hun_medium_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Turan II uses an upgraded 75 mm gun for improved firepower. Improved radios have also been added for consistent communication between vehicles in large operations."

Inspired by the armour sloping present in designs such as the Panther and T-34, the Tas incorporates similar elements into its armour while maintaining a degree of mobility.\n\nThis tank represents a good blend of firepower, mobility and armour; however, the techniques used in the construction of this vehicle are relatively novel for Hungarian engineers, resulting in high costs and low reliability."

Due to the necessity of fighting in close range and the painstaking process of reloading the vehicle, the Sturm Tiger struggles from subpar breakthrough and defense."

While very effective in combat when used against other tanks, its bulky size means that it makes for an easy target on the battlefield. This results in a low defense that allows the tank to be routed, given enough suppressive fire from air and ground forces."
